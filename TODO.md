# TODO - Resume Analyzer Project

## PERSISTENT REMINDER
ðŸ”„ **ALWAYS MAINTAIN**: TODO.md, ACTIONS.md, and SUMMARY.md files throughout the project lifecycle

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL GAPS FROM REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] **AI-Powered Analysis**: Replace basic regex with free AI agent for ATS analysis
- [ ] **Visual Highlighting**: Add colored borders (green/yellow/red) to document text areas
- [ ] **0-100 Scoring**: Change from A-D grades to 0-100 numerical scoring system
- [ ] **Mobile-First Design**: Implement responsive design from mobile to desktop
- [ ] **AI Rewrite Feature**: Add AI rewrite functionality with download capability

## High Priority Tasks
- [x] ~~Fix import errors in app.py (PyMuPDF import issue)~~
- [x] ~~Create uploads directory structure~~
- [x] ~~Implement actual resume analysis logic (currently placeholder)~~
- [ ] **Implement free AI agent integration** (HuggingFace Transformers or OpenAI-compatible API)
- [ ] **Add document text highlighting system**
- [ ] **Convert scoring to 0-100 scale**
- [ ] **Redesign UI for mobile-first responsive layout**

## Medium Priority Tasks  
- [ ] Add support for more file formats
- [ ] Implement resume rewriting functionality
- [ ] Add download functionality for rewritten resumes
- [ ] Improve UI/UX design
- [ ] Add progress indicators during analysis

## Low Priority Tasks
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add logging functionality
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add configuration management
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

## Current Issues Identified
1. **Import Error**: Line 1 has malformed import statement mixing Flask imports with PyMuPDF
2. **Missing Static Files**: CSS and JS files referenced but not present
3. **Placeholder Logic**: Analysis logic is hardcoded placeholder data
4. **Missing Directory**: uploads directory may not exist
5. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for edge cases

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Fix the import statement in app.py
2. Create missing static files and directories
3. Implement basic analysis logic
4. Test file upload functionality
